NOTES OF JSS1

we use javascript in web application / mobile application / networking applications
it is also used in the development of games


with writing node <file name> in terminal you can run js in terminal.

in js you dont have to mention datatypes while creating an variable he system will itself figure out the datatype with the value of variable.

you can declare a variable with both let and var but the difference is that the scope of let is local mean while the scope of var is global also you can re-declare a variable in var but can in let.

with the help of const you can a variable a constant value that can not be changed.

rule for naming a variable:
1. it cannot be keyword.
2. it must be meaningfull.
3. it can't start with a no.
4. can't contain any space or '_'.
5. use camelcase.


Primitive Types:

1. String -> sequence of characters
2. Number -> all types of integers , floating point , double, etc. are lye in this
3. Boolean -> true/false
4. Undefined -> when a variable is declared but its value is not alloted then it is called undefined
5. Null -> when a varible is declared and its is null or empty then it is null


Dynamic Typing: in javascript you can change the type of data in variable and it will run without any error
Example: let a = 5;
console.log(a);
a = 'himanshu';
console.log(a);


Refernce Type:

1. Objects    
2. Arrays
3. Fenctions


we can run javascript in both client and server site.

Operators:-

1. Arithmetic:-'+','-','*','/','%','**'.
pre/post increment:- '++x','x++','--x','x--'.
2. Assignment:
3. Compoarison:equlity , >=,<=,!=.
4. Bitwise:- bitwise AND , bitwise OR.
5. Logical:- 'AND--&&','OR--||','NOT--!'

Equality oprrators:-

loose equlity :- '==' a/c to this only the has to be the same it does not care about the data type
strict equality :- '==='a/c to this both the value and the type of has to be the same

Ternary operater:-
it is used to implement the if else value in a condition 
syntax:-  cndition val1 : val2 ;
if the condition is true then val1 will be implemented otherwise val2 will be used 


Operator Precedence :- Same as it is in c,c++,python

++	Increment	First	R -> L
--	Decrement	First	R -> L
—	Negation	First	R -> L
!	NOT	        First	R -> L
*, /,	Multiplication, Second	L -> R
 %       division,
        modulus	
+, —	Addition,       Third	L -> R
        subtraction	
+	Concatenation	Third	L -> R
<, <=	Less than,      Fourth	L -> R
        less than,
         or equal	
>, >=	Greater than,   Fourth	L -> R
        greater than,
        or equal	
==	Equal	        Fifth	L -> R
!=	Not equal	Fifth	L -> R
===	Identity	Fifth	L -> R
!==	Non-identity	Fifth	L -> R
&&	AND	        Sixth	L -> R
||	OR	        Sixth	L -> R
?:	Ternary	        Seventh	R -> L
=	Assignment	Eighth	R -> L
+=, -=, Arithmetic      Eighth	R -> L
 and    assignment
so on.		




CONTROL Statements:-

1. If-else
2. Switch


Loops:-

1. For loop
2. While loop
3. Do-While loop
4. Infinite loop
5. For-in loop
6. For-of loop
