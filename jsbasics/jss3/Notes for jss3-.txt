Notes for jss3:-

In-built objects && arrays:-

In-built objects:-

1. Math:- use mdn

2. String:- strings are primitive but you can make them into object by using proper syntax

you can also convert a primitive type string into an object by usin the (.) notation - > lastName.length,etc

 In the string you can use many functions :- touppercase(),tolowercase(),length,string_name(n),includes(),startswith(),endwith(),trim(),trimstart(),trimend(),indexof(),replace().


3. Temaplate Literal:-  The template literal are used to so that w dont have to use the escape sequences in a string. if we use ``(backtiks) instead of ''(single colons).

4. Date and Time:- 

ARRAYS:-

it is an object/reference type whict is collection of items. in java script an array can store multiple datatypes of data.
â€ª
Adding new elements:- insertion in array can be done in three conditions ->end: .push()
									   begin: .unshift()
									   Middle: .splice(index , del_count, content)
Finding elements:- you can search elements in array by .indexOf(),.includes() but this won't be applied on the objects. So for finding 			   elements in objects/refrences we have to use callback functions.
Removing elements:-deletion in array can be done in three conditions ->    end: .pop()
									   begin: .shift()
									   Middle: .splice(index , no. of elements to delete)
Splitting elements:-
Combining elements:-

Spread operatopr
